\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions:\begin{CompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{interface_i_m_s_r_gravity}{IMSRGravity} (\hyperlink{interface_i_m_s_r_gravity}{IMSRGravity} is a wrapper class for an NSDictionary, which contains the gravitational attraction at the surface of several celestial bodies, such as Earth, Moon and Jupiter )}{\pageref{interface_i_m_s_r_gravity}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{interface_i_m_s_r_point_object}{IMSRPointObject} (IMSPointObject represents a point mass in a cartesian coordinate system )}{\pageref{interface_i_m_s_r_point_object}}{}
\end{CompactList}
