\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{interface_i_m_s_r_gravity}{IMSRGravity} is a wrapper class for an NSDictionary, which contains the gravitational attraction at the surface of several celestial bodies, such as Earth, Moon and Jupiter. 

The NSDictionary is initialized from a property list (Gravity.plist).

Gravity is always negative. The units are meters/sec$^{\mbox{2}}$ . 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}
